name=Surface Triangulation
qgisMinimumVersion=2.08
description=Plugin useful for the triangulation of a surface from both a dtm raster layer (.ASC is mandatory) or contour vector layer. If the input is a raster file the triangulation is built on the grid points, three output files are possible: .txt .stl (binary) .stl (ASCII). If the input is a vector file the triangulation is computed using a Delaunay algorithm, one output file is possible: .txt

about=Input raster. It MUST be an .ASC file (with 6 lines header: ncols, nrows, xllcorner, yllcorner, cellsize, NODATA_value). If you have a raster of dirrefent format, convert it into .ASC (Arc/Info ASCII Grid) using QGIS conversion tool, being careful not to resize it. 
Input vector.  The vector contour layer can be created using QGIS Extraction\Contour tool from any raster format (i.e. .ASC is not mandatory). 
Output:	.txt file composed by two blocks: 1) the vertices of the triangulation, in the form #ID x y z 2) the triangles, represented as connections of three points, in the form #ID1 #ID2 #ID3
	.stl ASCII file, see format specifications at www.fabbers.com/tech/STL_Format
	.stl binary file, see format specifications at www.fabbers.com/tech/STL_Format
The .stl is obtained using numpy-stl package.
